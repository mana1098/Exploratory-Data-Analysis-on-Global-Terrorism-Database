# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Database

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database. The analysis aims to identify terrorism hot zones, causal factors, and provide strategic insights to mitigate terrorism risks.

## Duration

January 2021 - May 2021

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive EDA**: Performed in-depth analysis to identify terrorism hot zones and causal factors.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilized Pandas and NumPy for efficient data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. **Multi-faceted Analysis**: Examined attack frequencies, geographic distributions, and prevalent attack types by region.
5. **Strategic Insights**: Delivered actionable insights and recommendations for terrorism risk mitigation.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Processing Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset**: Global Terrorism Database

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the Global Terrorism Database to ensure data quality and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Conducted thorough exploration of terrorism patterns, trends, and factors.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapped terrorism hot zones and analyzed geographic distributions of incidents.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Examined attack frequencies and types across different regions and time periods.
5. **Causal Factor Identification**: Investigated potential causal factors contributing to terrorism incidents.
